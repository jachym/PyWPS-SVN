This program is simple implementation of OGC's [http://opengeospatial.org]
Web Processing Service (OpenGIS(r) Web Processing Service - OGC 05-007r7)
version 1.0.0 from 2007-06-08

Target of this application is to bring functionality of GIS GRASS
[http://grass.osgeo.it] to the World Wide Web - it should work like
wrapper for modules of this GIS. Though GRASS was at the first place in the
focus, it is not necessary to use it's modules - you can use any program
you can script in Python or other language.

This first version was written with support of Deutsche Bundesstiftung
Umwelt, Osnabrueck, Germany on the spring 2006. SVN server was hosted by
GDF-Hannover, Hannover, Germany; today at Intevation GmbH, Germany.

Current development is supported mainly by:
Help Service - Remote Sensing s.r.o
Cernoleska 1600
256  01 - Benesov u Prahy
Czech Republic
Europe

For setting see comments in 'etc' directory and documentation.
